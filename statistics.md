Below I've provided a few examples of my work in statistics. Most of this work is Bayesian and topics covered range from Generalized Linear Models to time series analysis.

### Quantile Spectral Analysis (Fall 2018)
Below are some slides I created for a presentation on quantile spectral analysis of time series data. The slides provide a comparison of quantile spectral analysis and traditional spectral analysis and then transition to some applied examples of quantile spectral analysis. Quantile spectral analysis of fMRI or EEG data will be a major component of my Master's capstone project.

### Hierarchical Extension of a Poisson GLM to Accomodate Overdispersion (Fall 2018)
Given some data on the number of manufacturing faults in fabric rolls of given lengths, we were asked to compare the relative fits of a Bayesian Poisson GLM and a Hierarchical Bayesian Poisson GLM. In this case, there was more variability in the data than the Poisson GLM was able to handle, and the hierarchically extended model performed much better. More details are included in the links below.

### Bayesian Multinomial Regression (Fall 2018)

In this problem set, we were asked to complete the following tasks. 
1. Prove that we can model the probability of a binary event taking place using logistic or probit regression. 
2. Fit a Bayesian multinomial regression model to predict the primary food choice of alligators using gender and length as predictors. 
3. Show that, when using continuation-ratio logits, one can decompose a multinomial regression into multiple binomial regressions. Apply this approach to predict the toxicity of a certain chemical to mice, again in a Bayesian way.
