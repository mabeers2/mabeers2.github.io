<center> <font size = "+3"> <b> About Me </b> </font> </center>

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Statistics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I worked on spectral analysis of time series data under the supervision of [Dr. Raquel Prado](https://raquel.soe.ucsc.edu). While many areas of mathematics, statistics and computer science fascinate me, I'm particularly interested in Bayesian Statistics and efforts to make machine learning approaches that are typically inscrutable more interpretable. 

Outside of school I'm an active person. In particular, I'm an avid mountain biker and regularly take advantage of the incredible trails around Santa Cruz. Additionally, I've recently acquired the  exhilarating if exorbitantly expensive hobby of snowboarding. On the quieter side, I enjoy reading and playing the piano. 

A more complete summary of my academic history can be found in my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf), and some examples of my work in machine learning and statistics can be found by navigating to the corresponding tabs in the menu bar above.
