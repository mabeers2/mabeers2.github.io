<center> <font size = "+3"> <b> About Me </b> </font> </center>

I am graduate student in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics department at the University of California, Santa Cruz working under the supervision of [Dr. Raquel Prado](https://raquel.soe.ucsc.edu). Though I'm currently in the Master's program, I hope to transition to the PhD program at the end of the 2018-2019 academic year. While many areas of mathematics, statistics and computer science fascinate me, I'm particularly interested in the application of Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning to time series data. 

Outside of school I'm an active person. In particular, I'm an avid mountain biker and regularly take advantage of the incredible trails around Santa Cruz. Additionally, I've recently acquired the  exhilarating if exorbitantly expensive hobby of snowboarding. On the quieter side, I enjoy reading and playing the piano. 

A more complete summary of my academic history can be found in my [resume](/assets/resume_website.pdf), and some examples of my work in machine learning and statistics can be found by navigating to the corresponding tabs in the menu bar above.
