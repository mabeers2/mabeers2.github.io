Below I've provided a few examples of my work in Machine Learning.

### Linear Regression & Naive Bayes Text Classification
In this problem set, we were asked to:

1. Simulate some numerical data with noise and fit a few linear regressions, with and without ridge regularization to this data to find best fitting coefficients. While regression coefficients have a closed form expression in both cases, this problem was made more challenging by the fact that some of the matrices we were trying to invert were near singular so a numerical minimization approach had to be implemented. 

2. Implement a Naive Bayes Classifier to classify emails as ham or spam. We also identified the words that discriminated between ham and spam most strongly.
